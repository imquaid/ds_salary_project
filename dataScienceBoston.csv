Over the past 25 years, we grew from startup to $2.75 billion in annual revenue and are confident that we still have a huge, multi-year growth opportunity ahead of us. Our confidence is driven by two primary factors: firstly, ~80% of the market segment for small businesses’ marketing materials is still served through traditional offline channels, often lacking the convenience and cost advantages from greater scale that we can offer our customers. Secondly, there is a significant opportunity to accelerate our activity in adjacent product segments such as packaging, apparel, signage, or corporate line of business accounts. We are a profitable business with an entrepreneurial mindset, and throughout our history we have proven our commitment to investing for long-term horizons.

Since our inception, Vistaprint has sought to disrupt our market and to build a transformational and enduring business. Over the past 20 years, we’ have reinvented ourselves frequently in service of this mission. Change is in our DNA.

To enable top-notch data science and analytics capabilities, we have made major multi-year investments in a cloud-based, service-oriented and data-rich technology platform. The new platform has already launched in one country and will be rolled out across Europe during 2020, unlocking significant capability and hence, opportunity for growth.

89,Senior Product Manager,$77K-$142K (Glassdoor Est.),"ABOUT HOPPER

At Hopper, we’re on a mission to make booking travel faster, easier, and more transparent. We are leveraging the power that comes from combining massive amounts of data and machine learning to build the world’s fastest-growing travel app -- one that enables our customers to save money and travel more. With over $235M CAD in funding from leading investors in both Canada and the US, Hopper is primed to continue its path toward becoming the go-to way to book travel as the world continues its shift to mobile.

Recognized as the fastest-growing travel app by Forbes and one of the world’s most innovative companies by Fast Company two years in a row, Hopper has been downloaded over 40 million times and has helped travelers plan over 100 million trips and counting. The app has received high praise in the form of mobile accolades such as the Webby Award for Best Travel App of 2019, the Google Play Award for Standout Startup of 2016 and Apple’s App Store Best of 2015.

Take off with us!

THE ROLE

Product Managers at Hopper are “smart creatives” that will take the Hopper app from a disruptive, startup product to being the global leader in mobile travel. As a Product Manager, you will work at the intersection of development, data science, and user experience, as well as have a competitive understanding of the travel landscape to facilitate the creation of successful new features. On any given day - whether you’re weighing the tradeoffs of offering new features, scoping and specifying solutions, or shepherding features through development - your contribution will be critical to Hopper’s current and future success.

Hopper’s Air product has been one of the biggest disruptors in the travel space since its launch in early 2015, helping travelers plan over 100 million trips and save nearly $2.5 billion along the way by leveraging big data technologies to help users understand the best time and destinations to fly, and more importantly, the best time to book airfare. We are looking for Product Managers to own the product roadmap to scale the Air product to be the preeminent destination for travelers when purchasing flights. This means exciting opportunities to own the booking funnel, sell ancillary products, and alleviate anxiety for millions of travelers. If you’re looking to dive deep into the challenges of scaling an established product to the market leader, look no further.

THE PRODUCT

Until recently, billions of dollars of flights and hotels had been purchased through Hopper by customers paying in full for their trip at time of booking. Over the last several years, installment payments have changed the way consumers spend money online, and in travel particularly, with over 30% of online shoppers stating they would not have made a purchase had the option to finance it not existed. This problem is particularly pronounced in travel, given the need to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars upfront often several months prior to their trip.

While the largest travel companies in the world now plug in to third party widgets to offer customers the ability to finance their trips, Hopper is leveraging its data science DNA to build an internal banking and lending function to offer this natively, the first travel company in the world to do so. Installments payments launched on Hopper in April 2020, is scaling quickly, and requires a senior product person to own it end-to-end.

IN THIS ROLE, YOU WILL:
Manage a product roadmap for a set of features from inception through implementation; collect requirements, establish key performance metrics, craft the user experience, and drive execution
Collaborate closely with data science to dive deep into our data to understand our users
Work with business leaders to help shape and drive business cases for product features
Ideate and wireframe new features that will be in the hands of millions of users across the globe
Identify the essential qualities of each feature: what's important, what's not, how can we limit cost and risk?
Understand and explain complex technical issues, discern impact, and communicate them to maximize clarity and drive resolution
Use good judgment to make appropriate trade-offs when scoping and specifying solutions, ensuring that anything we build adds value to the business and continues to delight our users
A PERFECT CANDIDATE HAS:
Thrived in a consumer product role and delivered delightful features at scale
An innovative and detail-oriented approach to problem-solving
The instinct to get on a whiteboard and explain their thinking, and even faster to document that thinking into expected use cases and user behaviors, driving UX for new features from start to finish
Exceptional ability to grasp, manage, and articulate complex systems
Experience connecting innovative solutions to real-world, user problems with actual business needs of a rapidly scaling organization
Technical depth that allows you to communicate with, understand, and earn the respect of world-class engineers and data scientists
A track record of being proactive and persuading colleagues by constructing a compelling narrative both in-person and in-writing
Past success analyzing data, drawing accurate conclusions, and adjusting strategy accordingly
No ego. Strong focus on doing what is right for the customer and the company
Experience with mobile product development strongly preferred
Experience with GDS, CRS, airline, hotel and/or other travel systems a plus
